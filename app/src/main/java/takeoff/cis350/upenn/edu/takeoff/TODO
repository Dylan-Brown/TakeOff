Due by First Iteration:

(Search Results) A JSON to Flight-class converter (JSON dummydata) to display the search results.
Put this in FlightDataReader

(Create User) User information should be stored (clientside) in a UserDatabase, which can be done with SQLite.
This is so that updated user information is saved everytime you close the app.

The FlightResults page (note: different than the FlightResultR and FlightResultA) should be a
ListView.
