     * IDEA FOR PAGE LAYOUT
     *
     * Group names need to be displayed
     * Group members on left, title: user's group, group flights on bottom
     * Have to have some kind of method to accept a group invitation
     * Possibly a notification activity that is an intermediary between the authentication and tabs
     * Can do next iteration, now we will just pass the invite as absolute and add them to the group
     * Possibly add names to users so the group functionality is a litle more aesthetic
